           <b>John Ammon - Softwere Developer</b>  <br/>

            <br/> Hey there! I'm John, a passionate front-end developer with a creative edge. I'm a proud graduate of the Turing School of Software & Design, where I honed my skills and fostered a deep love for web development.
            
            During my time at Turing, I had the incredible opportunity to collaborate on a multitude of exciting projects. From crafting immersive user experiences to building dynamic and responsive interfaces, I thrive in the fast-paced, collaborative environment that the school provided. These projects not only challenged my technical abilities but also taught me the value of effective teamwork and communication.

            As a front-end developer, I specialize in bringing designs to life with clean, elegant code and intuitive user interactions. I have a strong command of <em>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</em>. 
            Currently, I'm also diving into the world of <em>TypeScript</em>, expanding my skill set and exploring the advantages it brings to modern web development."

            Beyond code, I find inspiration in the art of web design, creating visually appealing and intuitive experiences that leave a lasting impact. I believe in the power of a well-crafted user interface to enhance journeys and spark joy. Passionate about leveraging technology for meaningful solutions, I prioritize building accessible websites and optimizing performance. My dedication ensures high-quality work that exceeds expectations.
            
            As a proud single parent, I have successfully raised my son for eight years, instilling in me a strong sense of responsibility, resilience, and adaptability. Together, we embrace the beauty of the mountains and find joy in every step we take.
            <br/>

            <br/>I am excited to bring my expertise, creativity, and life experiences to collaborate on boundary-pushing projects. Through technology, I aspire to make a positive impact on the world we live in. Let's create remarkable digital experiences together!"
